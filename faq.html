                    The Odin Project is for absolute beginners in the world of web development and those who have tried other resources without success. In reality, The Odin Project is for anyone who wants to work as a web developer, do freelancing work, build a startup, or just hack together a homepage for yourself. All the tools you need are here. <span class="bold">You should consider yourself fairly competent with personal computers and open to using a non-Windows based Operating System.</span>

                <p class="card__details">
                    We’ve built an in-depth curriculum designed to take you 100% of the way to becoming a web developer. Many other resources out there teach you just the basics of programming. With The Odin Project you’ll create your own websites, games, and social media sites.

                <p class="card__details">
                    The curriculum has also been designed in a modular fashion, making skimming through lessons a breeze.

                    The goal of The Odin Project is to provide a complete path for students to go from zero programming knowledge to employed as web developers while working with other students and picking up the skills to become self sufficient along the way.

                    We won't have any of this 'Learn it all in two days!' BS. You can't start from scratch and learn true web development in such a short period of time and you know it. It's highly unlikely that you'll be employable after a weekend workshop or a one-month part-time course.
                </p>

                <p class="card__details">
                    On the other hand, you don't necessarily need to put in 4 years getting a CS degree. 80% of what they cover won't be used during a typical web developer's early career and it's not necessary to get hired. So why not learn the 20% and learn the rest while you're getting paid on the job?
                </p>

                <p class="card__details">
                    We've essentially distilled down what you most need to learn to hit that employable level, but it's still a healthy dose of learning. Depending how fast you learn, it will take roughly 1000 hours of work to hit that sweet spot. If you're naturally more technical or come from a technical background, it may be a bit faster. If you're less technical or brand new to all this, it will take longer. Don't despair! When you think about it, that's pretty much the same learning curve you had to climb to learn anything worthwhile so far in life.

                    The Odin Project contains three tracks for students to choose from: <a href=""

                        Javascript</a>, and <a href="" class="card__details">Frontend only</a>. The Ruby on Rails track
                    gives a general overview of what fullstack is. This is the default track for most beginners. The
                    Javascript track focuses more on the connection between the webpage and the data with Javascript and
                    NodeJS. The Frontend track primarily goes over HTML, CSS and Javascript but no Ruby on Rails. Below
                    are some courses that are included in these curriculums:

                <p class="card__details">

                    The Web Development 101 course will give you a chance to explore several of the languages and
                    technologies you’ll need to know on your journey to becoming a web developer. Web Development 101
                    introduces HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, Rails, Git, databases and more. We’ve also created
                    mini-projects that give you a chance to test your new knowledge by building your own applications
                    and websites!

                <p class="card__details">
                    The Odin Project takes a back-to-front approach to learning Ruby on Rails. We start with a <a href="" class="card__link">strong foundation in Ruby</a> and an understanding of databases before migrating into <a href="" class="card__link">Ruby on Rails</a> (which is a framework built using Ruby).

                </p>

                <p class="card__details">
                    The Odin Project then delves deep into <a href="" class="card__link">HTML</a> and <a href="" class="card__link">CSS</a>, along with <a href="" class="card__link">Javascript</a> to give you all the tools necessary to make websites flow, load quickly, and look great. Along the way you’ll learn Git and deployment so you can build your own portfolio, collaborate with others, and see your work on the web.

                <p class="card__details">
                    Finally, The Odin Project will provide you with opportunities to work with legacy codebases and open-source projects. We’ll also cover areas specifically intended to help when you’re <a href="" class="card__link">looking for employment</a>.

                    <h2>How is The Odin Project different from other programs?</h2>

                    <img src="./images/faq/minus-solid.svg" alt="Minus Sign">

                </div>

                <p class="card__details">

                    The Odin Project is different from other online programs in that it pulls the best resources from
                    around the web and compiles them to create a complete curriculum. In many other programs the
                    material is formatted to meet their specific curriculum. This means that not all of the lessons are
                    top-notch. The Odin Project sidesteps this downfall by pulling various free resources from around
                    the web and compiles them in one place.

                </p>

                <p class="card__details">
                    The Odin Project also attempts to develop your problem solving skills when it requires you to
                    install programs on your local computer. As developers, programming errors frequently arise and
                    knowing how to decipher error messages is critical. These problem solving skills are frequently
                    ignored by other programs.

                </p>

                <p class="card__details">
                    Lastly, The Odin Project is project based. Other programs require you to simply input the correct
                    answer. It is difficult to retain any knowledge by learning the bare minimum syntax. The Odin
                    Project is designed with projects built from the ground up giving you real-world experience that you
                    can use to build your portfolio and get hired as a web developer!

                    There are dozens of frameworks and technology stacks to choose from and, frankly, they do pretty

                    It’s also used by many tech companies and has a strong community of developers who support it.

                    Ruby on Rails lets you deploy a functioning website in hours instead of weeks. Rails also provides a

                    Odin is a figure from Norse mythology, the allfather of the gods. He is portrayed as powerful and
                    fickle (as they often are) but also wise and cunning. His search for knowledge is a thing of legends
                    - he <a href="" class="card__link">gave his eye for the wisdom of ages</a> and hung from the world
                    tree, pierced by his own spear, for nine days and nights to <a href="" class="card__link">gain the
                        knowledge of runes</a>.
